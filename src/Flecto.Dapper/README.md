# Flecto.Dapper

**Flecto.Dapper** is a SQL query builder and adapter for [Dapper](https://github.com/DapperLib/Dapper), built on top of [Flecto.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Flecto.Core).

It takes strongly-typed filter, sorting, and pagination models from `Flecto.Core` and translates them into valid SQL queries with parameters.

ðŸ”— See usage examples and implementation details on [GitHub Pages](https://eveissim.github.io/Flecto).
